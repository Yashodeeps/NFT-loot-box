# NFT Loot Box Smart Contract

## Description

The NFT Loot Box is a blockchain-based gaming smart contract built on the Aptos network that implements a randomized reward system. Users can purchase loot boxes using AptosCoin and receive random NFT rewards with different rarity tiers. The contract features a fair and transparent reward distribution system where users have a 70% chance of receiving common rewards, 25% chance for rare rewards, and 5% chance for legendary rewards.

Key features include:
- **Secure Payment System**: Integration with AptosCoin for seamless transactions
- **Randomized Rewards**: Pseudo-random reward generation ensuring fair distribution
- **User Tracking**: Complete history of purchases and rewards for each user
- **Transparent Economics**: All funds go directly to the loot box creator
- **Multiple Rarity Tiers**: Common, Rare, and Legendary reward categories

## Vision
